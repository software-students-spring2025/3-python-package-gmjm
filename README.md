## How to Import

1. Run the following command in terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install pyriddles
   ```
2. Confirm proper installation:
   ```bash
   pip show pyriddles
   ```
3. Next, import the desired functions (example usage below):
   ```python
   from pyriddles import arbitrary_riddle, get_answer, ...
   ```

## Example Usage of Key Functions:

- `arbitrary_riddle`: 
  - Parameters:
    - None 
  - Returns:
    - A random riddle_id to be used in other methods
  - Example: 
    - ```python
      # Demonstrate arbitrary_riddle
      riddle_id = arbitrary_riddle()
      print(f"Random riddle ID: {riddle_id}")
      ```

- `get_riddle_by_difficulty`: 
  - Parameters:
    - A difficulty (of 'easy', 'medium', or 'hard')
  - Returns:
    - A random riddle based on difficulty
  -  Example:
     -  ```python
        # Demonstrate proper usage of get_riddle_by_difficulty
        print(get_riddle_by_difficulty("easy"))

        # Demonstrate improper usage of get_riddle_by_difficulty
        print(get_riddle_by_difficulty("extra hard"))
        ```
- `list_difficulties`:
  - Parameters:
    - None
  - Returns:
    - A list of available difficulties
  - Example:
    - ```python
      #Demonstrate list_difficulties
      print(list_difficulties())
      ```


- `get_answer`: 
  - Parameters:
    - riddle_id : The id number for a riddle in `config.py`
  - Returns:
    - A boolean value depending on the verity of the user's answer
  - Example:
    - ```python
      #Demonstrate get_answer
      answer = get_answer(riddle_id)
      print(f"The answer to riddle {riddle_id} is: {answer}")
      ```


- `get_hint`:
  - Parameters:
    - riddle_id
    - hint_type (set to auto normally)
    - max_attempts : the maximum number of tries for a riddle
  - Returns: A singular (usually random) hint
  - Example:
    - ```python
      #Example usage of get_hint

      hint = get_hint(riddle_id, "soundsalad_hint")
      print("Generated hint (soundsalad_hint):", hint)

      hint_auto = get_hint(riddle_id, "auto")
      print("Generated hint (auto):", hint_auto)
      ```

- `get_hints`:
  - Parameters: 
    - riddle_id
    - hint_type : Usually randomly selected, but can be input manually for a specific type
    - limit : The total number of hints desired
  - Returns: 
    - Several hints
  - Example:
    ```python
    #Example usage of get_hints

    hints_list = get_hints(riddle_id, "auto", limit=5)
    print("Generated list of hints (auto):", hints_list)
    ```

- **pipenv** (for dependency and virtual environment management)

If you donâ€™t have `pipenv`, install it with:

```sh
pip install pipenv
```

---

### **Setting Up the Development Environment**

1. Clone the repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/software-students-spring2025/3-python-package-gmjm.git
    cd 3-python-package-gmjm
    ```

2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies

    ```sh
    pipenv install
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```sh
    pipenv shell
    ```

### **Running the Package Locally**

To execute the package code locally, use:

```sh
python -m pyriddles
```

---

### **Running Tests**

To ensure that all functions work correctly, you can run the tests manually using:

```sh
pytest
```

---

### **Building the Package**

To manually build the package into distributable artifacts:

```sh
python -m build
```

---

### Importing the Package
To import the entire package for use in your code, add the following line to the top of your file

    import pyriddles

If you only want to import certain functions, add the following line to the top of your file:

    from pyriddles import func1, func2...
